# healthcare_rag
This project, "healthcare-rag," is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide informative responses to healthcare-related queries. It leverages various components to process, store, and retrieve information from a set of documents, combining the retrieved context with a language model to generate accurate and relevant answers.

Key Features:

 **Multi-format document processing**  
  Supports multiple input types like **PDFs, scanned documents, and images (JPG/PNG)**. This makes the system flexible for real-world healthcare files such as prescriptions, lab reports, discharge summaries, and medical images.  

 **OCR integration for scanned documents and images**  
  Uses **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to extract text from scanned PDFs and image files. This allows the system to read data even from documents that are not digitally searchable (e.g., scanned hospital reports).  

 **Table & chart data extraction**  
  Extracts structured information from tables (like patient test results, billing info) and charts/graphs (like lab trends, diagnostic graphs). This helps convert visual data into usable structured formats.  

 **Visual element recognition & indexing**  
  Identifies non-textual elements (such as medical diagrams, X-ray images, or icons) and indexes them, enabling retrieval of not just text but also relevant **visual context**.  

 **Local RAG-based search and retrieval (no API cost)**  
  Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using a **local vector database**. This means you can query documents intelligently (semantic search) **without relying on expensive external APIs**, keeping everything private and cost-free.  

 **Interactive Streamlit UI**  
  A simple, lightweight **web interface** built with Streamlit. Users can upload documents, view extracted content, and perform semantic searchesâ€”all in an intuitive dashboard.
